# Multilayered-Perceptron

Ever wondered how machines make decisions? Meet the perceptron, the simplest yet powerful artificial neuron. It's the cornerstone of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and plays a vital role in helping computers recognize patterns and make accurate predictions.

How a Perceptron Works:
1. Inputs: Takes in multiple pieces of numerical data.
2. Weights: Assigns significance to each input based on its importance.
3. Summation: Calculates a weighted sum of these inputs by multiplying each input by its weight.
4. Bias: Adds a bias term to adjust the decision threshold, allowing for fine-tuning.
5. Activation Function: Processes the weighted sum through an activation function, typically a step function, to determine the output.
6. Output: Produces either 1 or -1, effectively classifying the data into one of two categories.

In essence, a perceptron creates a linear boundary to separate data, laying the groundwork for more complex neural networks used in tasks like image recognition and natural language processing.
